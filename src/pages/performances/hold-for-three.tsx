    <h1>HOLD FOR THREE</h1>
    <h2>Sonic Performance</h2>
    <h3>2023</h3>
    <p>
      ‘Hold for Three’ is a sonic performance which morphs bodies into machinehood and objects into organs. Kayla Elrod and Lottie Sebes probe the sonic capacities of various bellows, operating them as instruments, extensions and prosthetics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sonic worlds are built from wheezing breath, creaking hinges, loosening screws, and hot air hissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outmoded objects of production are transformed into otherworldly organs, powered by mechanical respiration, a cycle of tension and release. What slips from a hosed mouth on the floor of an old ship?
