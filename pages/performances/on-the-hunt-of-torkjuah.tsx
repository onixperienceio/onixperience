                        Tokjuah is the civilizing hero of the Wich√≠, a native community of South America.
A multifaceted and hilarious hero-antihero: Tokjuah is the unbridled protagonist of adventures, misfortunes, triumphs, defeats, mistakes, geniuses, loyalties, cheating; he can be the savior of humanity with one of his actions, or cause great disasters just by whim or negligence. Although he is an anthropomorphic entity, we often see him interact with animals and even become one of them or try to imitate them. &#34;A non-Western way of thinking, with its own patterns and logics&#34;.
